1) Initialization of a docker swarm 
	> docker swarm init 
	
2) For help use --help at the end.
	> docker swarm init --help
	
  Example:
	> docker swarm init --advertise-addr <ip>
	Swarm initialized: current node (fdkjghd8347hdsjgh38) is now a manager.

3) To add a worker node in this swarm, run the following command:
	> docker swarm join --token <swarm manager tocken id> <manager ip>:2377

4) To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.

   4.2. To add a worker to this swarm just copy and paste above command in the worker node.
	   > docker swarm join --token <swarm manager tocken id> <manager ip>:2377

   4.3 To add manager to this swarm.
	
    	4.3.1 find the manager token.
		   > docker swarm join-token -q manager

	    4.3.2 join this node to another manager node as a manager.
		   > docker swarm join --token <token id> <host-ip>:2377


5) Node Operation:
	
	a) For checking nodes in the cluster
    > docker node ls
	
	b) For promoting node as a manager
    > docker node promote (node-id)
	
	c) For demoting node as a manager
    > docker node demote (node-id)

	d) For removing node from manager when node is down
    > docker node rm <node-id>
    
6) To see name of a host in cluster
	> docker system info --format '{{.Name}}'

7) To list down all host(node) in cluster (only work for manager node)
	> docker node ls
8) To set command sets some environment variables necessary for the local Docker client to find the remote Docker host, and to configure TLS-encrypted communication, whilst the second queries the remote Docker daemon for the host's name.	
	> eval $(docker-machine env node-01)
