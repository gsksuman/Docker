1) To check images present in docker repo 
 -> docker images
 -> docker image ls

2) To build a dockerfile we need atleast one image (scratch, alpine-java ...etc  we use alpine java. small and better for our projects)
 -> docker build -t tagname-for-the-image .

	here -t is used for tagging (giving a name to the image)
 
3) Saving the image as a .tar file (Export from repository)
	-> docker save image-name > image.tar

4) Loading the image from .tar (Import in repository)
	->docker load --input xyz.tar
